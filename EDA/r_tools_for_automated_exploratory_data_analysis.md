# Description

Before a predictive model is built, the data set must needs to be well understood. This process is usually referred to as the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). In the era of countless easily available, but noisy and large data sets, automation of EDA is a task that could greatly speed up data analysis and aid non-experts who need to deal with data. 
In this talk, I will describe many R packages for fast, automated EDA (autoEDA) with their strenghts and weaknesses. The talk is based on a paper "The Landscape of R Packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis" which was accepted  to the R Journal.
