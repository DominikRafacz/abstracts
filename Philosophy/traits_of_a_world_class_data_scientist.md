# Description

There is a lot of hype around AI on the current market, which drives the demand for data scientists. However, there are a lot of misconceptions about what the data scientist actually does from day to day.
 
Q: What does a data scientist do all day?
A: S/he builds models! 

This is (unfortunately) only partly true.

This talk aims to describe the complete process of a typical data science project from formulating a problem to model deployment and measuring impact. We focus on tools and methods in R that are crucial to becoming a successful data scientist. We stress the importance of problem definition and data preparation, which are often underestimated. We cover the pitfalls to avoid in data science projects using real-life examples. In the case of modeling part of the data science cycle, we focus on objectives such as library choice, interpretability, and business relevant metrics. We show that while Kaggle is a great playground to polish your modeling skills, its competitors’ objectives differ from those of business projects. Lastly, we comment on what happens when models leave the nest.
