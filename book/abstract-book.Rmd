# Introduction

The purpose of Why R? is to provide the space for the professional networking and knowledge exchange, between practitioners and students, from the area of statistical machine learning, programming, optimization and data science fields.

## Participants

The Why R? events are aimed at experienced data science practitioners although each conference gathers a significant percentage of students (~30%). Our participants recruit from very diverse backgrounds with a clear domination of mathematics (especially statistics) and computer science. All of them have occupations related to data science, including professional R developers (programmers), data engineers, machine learning practitioners and business analysts. One of the key advantages of Why R? is its ability to attract participants both from academia and industry.

## Pre-meetings

In 2019, Why R? 2019 was preceded by twelve pre-meetings in seven countries.
