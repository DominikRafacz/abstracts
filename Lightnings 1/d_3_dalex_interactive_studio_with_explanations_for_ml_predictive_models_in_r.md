# D3 + DALEX = Interactive Studio with Explanations for ML Predictive Models in R

Author: Hubert Baniecki (MI2 MiNI PW)

# Description

Static and dull plots might not be enough anymore. We are inevitably growing into fast paced society. The demand for responsive virtual reality has vastly increased these days.

The answer to that trend is the generic plotD3 function. It uses r2d3 package as an interface to D3 visualizations in R. D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It really helps you bring your data to life. Using r2d3 allows us to produce interactive and animated plots that provide more value and great scalability.  

We can greatly benefit from implementing and using plotD3 functions in R packages. Authors can present their ideas in various shapes or forms and easily indicate valuable information. Users get to experience visualisation on another level. It all comes at a cost of learning D3 and maintaining more code.

Explainable AI is a hot topic nowadays. Tools like DALEX, iBreakDown, auditor and many others came into existence to answer one simple question 'Why?'. Improving these explainers with interactive visualization makes them simply powerful. plotD3 allows for interactions between multiple plots that are not possible with more traditional tools out there like ggplot2. It is also free from client-server relationship. This is where it shines and as an example I can present the **modelStudio** package.
