# Integrating R and Python for reproducible business analytics

Author: Richard Louden (The Oakland Group)

# Description

Analytics without reproducibility, the ability to reproduce an output from its component parts, results in inherent risk. This is especially true in a business environment where staff can and will move to new jobs, leaving projects and work that may be vital for the business. In addition, analytics without collaboration can lead to wholly unsuitable results. This collaboration may come in the form of utilising different programming languages or additional input regarding business context. Both aspects require strong ways of working and suitable toolsets in order to be effective, which will be the main subject of this talk. Utilising previous experience of large businesses, from a management consulting and retail background, I aim to show how reproducibility can be improved with some simple methodologies, and collaboration aided with recent tools. Examples of such includes establishing a strong base to work from via utilising projects and working with paths correctly and improving collaboration with colleagues using tools such as reticulate and the draft redoc package.
The overall aim of this talk is to inspire those who do not currently utilise such practices to improve both their own workflows and those utilised within their company, for improved reproducibility and collaboration.
