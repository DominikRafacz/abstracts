# Description

Our study presents results of application of widely known asset allocation model proposed by Markowitz (1952) on regular and crypto markets. Our strategies are constructed with most important world equity indices and largest cryptocurrencies (in terms of market capitalization) on daily data for the last five years.  

Results are presented in form of interactive Shiny application. The user can easily get equity lines of analysed strategies and benchmark portfolios, as well as their performance and risk measures for selected strategy parameters. Our solution also reports historical portfolio composition at every point of time together with weights obtained in optimization process and presents dynamics of historical correlation between assets from regular and crypto markets. 

Our application also allows to perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to length of historical window, frequency of portfolio rebalancing and degree of financial leverage. This gives a chance for the user to easily manipulate those parameters and to observe how they affect the strategy results. 

The results presented in our application illustrate potential of risk diversification offered by new class of investable assets offered by crypto markets. Application is deployed in the cloud and the whole process of updating the data and portfolio rebalancing is performed automatically.
