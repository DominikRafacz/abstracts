# Description 

At Analyx, we build software product called SpendWorx. It is Shiny+R application to support marketing decisions. The software uses multiple mathematical models to predict sales and to optimize marketing spending. We present SpendWorx and we discuss selected technical, organizational and analytical challenges we have encountered during the development. We also present our best practises in development and what we learned along the way.
