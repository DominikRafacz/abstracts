# Selling solutions based on R (which is GPL licensed). Is this possible?

Author: Kamil Sijko (Transition Technologies)

# Descripition

Core R is licensed under GPL-2 / 3 which is really great license from user perspective: you can not only run the program, but also share the app, see and study the source code and even modify it if you wish. But let's look at this from perspective of a person or company that would like to use R skills for living / business.  GPL requires you to license your derivative work under GPL. How does this licensing model fit into corporations? Is it possible to integrate R code into closed-sourced solutions? Will this imply changes in licensing? Can we sell R-based solutions to customers? Can they re-sell our work without our consent? I will briefly answer all those questions based on our adventures with integrating R services into our proprietary software and consultations with lawyers and R-community. I will give examples of both good and bad ideas for business models involving R.
