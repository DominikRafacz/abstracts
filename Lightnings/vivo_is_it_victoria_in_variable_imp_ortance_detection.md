# Descripition

Your model predicts something and you would like to know which features were the most important? When a model has many features and plotting all one-dimensional summary statistics is troublesome, vivo indicates which variables are worth paying attention to. The vivo is an R package which calculates instance level feature importance (measure of local sensitivity). The feature importance is based on Ceteris Paribus profiles and can be calculated in a few variants. During the talk I will show how they are different and which to choose.
