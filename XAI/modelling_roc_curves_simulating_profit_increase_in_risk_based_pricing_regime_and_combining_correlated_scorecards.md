# Descripition

From time to time a business need appears to have a simple model to understand what is the impact of better machine learning tools in bank lending. As I have been working for some time on this, I would like to share a few effects in this area: modelling ROC curves, simulating profit increase in risk-based pricing regime and combining correlated scorecards. All with R.
