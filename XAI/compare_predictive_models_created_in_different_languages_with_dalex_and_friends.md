# Compare predictive models created in different languages with DALEX and friends

Author: Szymon Maksymiuk (MI2 DataLab / MiNI PW)

# Description

Friend of yours dared to claim that his model is better only because was built in Python or Julia?  Time to help you in your rightful battle against anyone who opposes superiority of your model!

First part of my presentation is dedicated for participants who would like to explain and compare models between R and Python. I will present functions I have developed that are now available in DALEX package.  They let us to build explainers of Python models in a unified way.

During the second part, I am going to familiarize participants with tools and ideas helpful in models comparison, such as residuals distribution comparison. Nowadays, we have plenty of different models that are easy to build and have similar performance, that is why we would like to have more criterions than pure MSE or AUC. Presentation will cover different approaches to that topic. The goal is to show information we can extract from our model’s output and the way we can present it. Some of these ideas are implemented in my package championChallenger.
