Author: Olga Kaminska (Britenet)

# Description

State change of patients in bipolar disorder may cause irreversible changes.
The aim of the project was to predict the state change  towards depression / mania in the examined patients. Each person goes through this disease differently, that's why personalization of the algorithm is so important. The study used methods of both supervised and unsupervised learning through data from real patients. The prepared solution is the first step to create a complete prognostic system that would make life easier for doctors and patients.
