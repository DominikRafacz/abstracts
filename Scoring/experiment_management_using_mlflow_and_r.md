# Experiment management using mlflow and R

Author: Michal Rudko (PwC)

# Description

There is nothing so painful as to have a perfect script on perfect data version producing perfect metrics only to discover that you donâ€™t remember what are the hyperparameters that were passed as arguments, what was the data set version, etc. Even reproducing the code of an ideal experiment is not that straightforward. Let's admit - it has always been somehow problematic to keep track of all of this - very often it required a custom code or even ...a spreadsheet was used in order not to get lost.
In my presentation I will cover how some of these challenges can be overcome by using an experiment management tool called mlflow. I will also share how we used this package to collect experiment metadata, organize it in a meaningful way and make it available to access and collaborate within our team on one of the advanced analytics projects at PwC Poland.
