# Descripition

This talk intends to highlight the applications / pitfalls of using categorical embeddings (from deep learning) in gradient boosting models, which is a kind of transfer learning. Word vectors are commonplace, so this talk focuses only general categorical variables (with high cardinality). This is a mixture of some theory and practice in R, and my experience of generating such embeddings.
