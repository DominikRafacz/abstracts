# Descripition

Algorithmic trading strategies are nowadays very commonly developed with the use of machine learning algorithms. One can generate the signal to sell or buy particular  assets with the advance of time based on number of arbitrages among which still developing is event arbitrage. It is a high-frequency strategy which trade on the market movements surrounding news announcements. As a foundation for analysis minutes provided by the Federal Open Market Commitee are considered. In order to extract the news sentiment, one can use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are a special kind of neural networks heavily applied in natural language processing. Having done that, one can examine the relationship between an asset behaviour and news sentiment and assess whether specific news sentiment is a significant explanatory variable in the forecast development. 

The aim of this presentation is to explain the idea of event arbitrage strategy, the process of extracting news sentiment which is then used as an explanatory variable in the modelling process and present a practical workshop based on Federal Open Market Commitee minutes with the comparison of different machine learning algorithms.
