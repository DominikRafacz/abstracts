# Descripition

Daytime satellite images in high-resolution are commonly used to derive features of regions or smaller areas using convolutional neural networks (CNN). One can identify meaningful features like the number and density of buildings, the prevalence of shadow area as a proxy for building height, the number of cars, density and length of roads, type of farmland, roof material, etc. CNNs are a special kind of multilayer neural networks applied in image recognition. CNNs are identifying boundaries (edges), which separate areas of different colors. Based on low level concepts (a curve, a straight line) one can build more high level concepts (a square, circle, etc.) and even more abstract concepts. Training a neural network is a very demanding and time consuming process that requires powerful computational resources. One of solutions is transfer learning, in which the model is not trained from scratch, but uses some pre-trained model, that was trained before on a large benchmark dataset to solve a similar problem.

The aim of this presentation is to explain the idea of meaningful features extraction from images with the use of convolutional neural networks and transfer learning and show a practical example based on the districts of Warsaw.
