# Description

Local Data Bank is Poland's largest database of the economy, society and the environment. LDB offers more than 40 thous. statistical features grouped thematically. According to European programme "Open data - access, standards and education" Statistics Poland released REST API to LDB database giving programmers much better access to the data. My package lets download data directly into R environment and provides set of quick tools like summarizing and visualising LDB data on charts and maps.
