# What we don't have but need. Some missing R functions in teaching econometrics

# Description

Despite buoyant number of R packages, some basic areas seem to be undeveloped. Some missing R functions overcomplicate advanced econometrics teaching, and in consequence, can make R less appealing to students. Especially, students not majoring in econometrics might be tempted to use other statistical software. To justify why R is the language of choice in teaching, a new package is proposed. The package tries to bridge the gap of missing R functions.
This paper proposes a preliminary version of the new package (fesuw). It consists of a few functions that appear not to be found in available packages. Functions for marginal effects of the binary choice models, ordinal logits, tobit models for a given set of values are proposed alongside with R-squared statistics of static and wide panel models and the linktest for binary dependent models functions.
