# Description

R can be the last thing that you think about in the context of games. But in fact it is an very good option if you need to prepare low-cost prototype. In the presentation I will show the set of useful functions those allow to create playable turn-based game similar to well-known Heroes of Might and Magic in Shiny. Moreover a few examples of AI algorithms in games will be presented.
