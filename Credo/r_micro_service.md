# R & MicroService

Author: Colin Fay Fay (ThinkR)

# Descripition

To some extent, the microservice philosophy has been there since the beginning of unix: as the first rule of the unix philosophy states, "write programs that do one thing and do it well". 

Almost 40 years after the writing of the UNIX philosophy, this mantra is now more  modern than ever, as we have entered in the era of micro service — instead of writing big monolithic applications, we now divide things into very small services that are orchestrated to work together. Which allow more flexibility, easier maintenance, and even more interoperability than ever. 

But how can we apply this to our favorite language, R? How can we build microservices with and for R? Why would we even want to do that? That's the very questions Colin will address in this talk about R & Microservices.
