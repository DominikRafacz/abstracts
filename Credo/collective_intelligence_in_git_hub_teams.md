# Collective intelligence in GitHub teams

# Descripition

We present the results of the analysis of developers working in GitHub repository hosting service with a focus on similarity and dissimilarity and their impact on team performance. We measure similarity or dissimilarity with hyperbolic self-organizing maps and then provide text mining and sentiment analysis on the available data on discussions among developers. Our results suggest that dissimilarity plays important role in networks related to information flow (e.g., following, issues networks) while similar developers tend to work on code (pullrequests). We also find diverse roles of heterophylic or homophylic connections — homogeneity enhances code development while heterogeneity helps in assessing user interactions (e.g., bug reports, feature suggestions, asking for help).
