Latent class trajectory modelling simplifies heterogeneous longitudinal datasets into homogeneous patterns or classes and so can be used to describe life-course exposures, such as weight trajectories or alcohol trajectories, which we can then relate to disease outcomes such as cancer risk. 

However, for a given dataset it is possible to derive hundreds of different models based on number of classes, model structure and trajectory property. So how do we know 

In this workshop, we delve deep into how to use R to fit these models, then to display model diagnostics using the LCTMtools package, then by using the published systematic framework to derive trajectories with helpful meanings, we use R to display our results to our clients or collaborators.
