# Multidimensional Scaling with the smacof package

Author: Barbara Jancewicz (OBM UW)

# Descripition

Multidimensional scaling attempts to recreate respondents' perception map using differences (distances) indicated in their answers. It was popular in psychometrics as well as market research studies. A couple of years ago a new algorithm (smacof) was created so the way in which the algorithm chooses the optimal solution became more intuitive. After few more years the authors of this new algorithm implemented it in R as a package called smacof. I would like to show you how useful multidimensional scaling can be both in academic and commercial setting, as it can help in interpretation and visualisation of complex data. I will also introduce a simple way to verify the quality of the obtained results.
