# Bringing interactivity into engineering courses with BERT-based Excel-R applications

# Description

With Excel being the computing tool most used by the engineering community, developing Excel applications that call R functions is highly desirable for engineers as it merges Excel's interactivity with a high level numerical environment. This paper was written with engineering trainers in mind. It should provide them with an applied and illustrative guide for easy development of applications that merge Excel and R using BERT as the interoperability solution. Simple examples are provided that exemplify the ease with which such applications can be created. Such applications, which are interactive by design since they use Excel as their front-end, can help engineering educators increase the attractiveness and dynamics of their engineering courses.
