# R for Entrepreneurs : supply chain automation case

Author: Francois Jacquet (artinlean sp. zoo)

# Descripition

I would like to share the journey I took to build from scratch a production grade machine learning workflow for automated stock and sales management, with emphasis on : 

- Hurdles in accessing/cleaning data at a commercial company and how I could overcome them
- How suprisingly fast it was for me to go from idea to working model in R
- How painful and key it is to make it production grade ( and one can in R too)
- Exchange with you on some principles I applied in my journey that helped a lot ( Lean start-up, Agile, continuous training, keeping higher purpose...)
