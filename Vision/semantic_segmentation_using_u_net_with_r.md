# Semantic segmentation using U-Net with R

Author: Michal Maj (Data Science Solutions Michal Maj)

# Descripition

In this presentation I will discuss semantic segmentation, which is one of the most interesting computer vision tasks, used e.g in self-driving cars or medical image analysis. I will present U-Net deep neural network model and show how to build it in R using Keras.
